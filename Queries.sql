from invoice 
group by(billing_city) 
order by invoice_total desc limit 1;

-- Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.
select customer.customer_id ,customer.first_name,customer.last_name,sum(invoice.total) as total from customer 
join invoice on customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
group by customer.customer_id order by(total) desc limit 1;

--Moderate Questions
-- Que.1 : Write query to return the email,first name,last name and genre of all Rock Music listeners.
-- Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.

select distinct email,first_name,last_name
from customer
join invoice on customer.customer_id = invoice.invoice_id
join invoice_line on invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
where track_id in(
		select track_id from track
		join genre on track.genre_id = genre.genre_id
		where genre.name like 'Rock'
)
order by email;

-- Que 2: Let's invite the artists who have the most Rock Music in our dataset.
-- Write a query that returns the artist name and total track count of top 10 rock bands.                                                                  

select artist.artist_id,artist.name, count(artist.artist_id) as number_of_songs
from track
join album on album.album_id = track.album_id
join artist on artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
join genre on genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
where genre.name like 'Rock'
group by artist.artist_id
order by number_of_songs desc
limit 10;

--Que 1: Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. 
-- Return the name and Milliseconds for each track.
-- Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first.

select name,milliseconds
from track 
where milliseconds > (
		select avg(milliseconds) as avg_track_length 
		from track)
order by milliseconds desc;


-- Advance Questions

/* Q1: Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent */

/* Steps to Solve: First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines. Now use this artist to find 
which customer spent the most on this artist. For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Customer, 
Album, and Artist tables. Note, this one is tricky because the Total spent in the Invoice table might not be on a single product, 
so you need to use the InvoiceLine table to find out how many of each product was purchased, and then multiply this by the price
for each artist. */
